- 👋 Hi, I’m @swaatomdotcom
- 👀 I’m interested in python, java and mobile development. Back in the day, I used to be a software developer. I guess I'm planning on making a comeback.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, kivy, kivymd. I'll probably be looking at native android development with android studio.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something worthwhile, but the day job is taking up too much of my time. Re-training takes up the rest. But check this space, because things will change.
